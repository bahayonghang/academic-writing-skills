# Common Errors in Academic Writing

Reference guide for common errors in academic English writing, with focus on Chinglish patterns.

## Overview

This guide covers common errors made by non-native English speakers, particularly those whose first language is Chinese. Understanding these patterns helps improve academic writing quality.

## Article Usage (a, an, the)

### Missing Articles

**Error**: Omitting articles where required

```latex
% Bad
Machine learning is powerful tool for data analysis.

% Good
Machine learning is a powerful tool for data analysis.
```

**Rule**: Singular countable nouns require an article (a/an/the)

### Incorrect Article Choice

**Error**: Using wrong article

```latex
% Bad
The machine learning has many applications.

% Good
Machine learning has many applications.
```

**Rule**: General concepts don't use "the"

### Overuse of "the"

**Error**: Adding "the" unnecessarily

```latex
% Bad
The deep learning is the subset of the machine learning.

% Good
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
```

## Preposition Usage

### "In" vs. "On" vs. "At"

**Time**:
```latex
% Correct
in 2024 (year)
in March (month)
on March 15 (specific date)
at 3:00 PM (specific time)
```

**Location**:
```latex
% Correct
in the paper (within)
on the page (surface)
at the conference (event/location)
```

### "For" vs. "To" vs. "Of"

**Purpose**:
```latex
% Bad
This method is used to solve the problem.

% Good
This method is used for solving the problem.
% or
This method is used to solve the problem.
```

## Verb Tense

### Present vs. Past

**Describing your work** (past):
```latex
% Correct

We implemented the algorithm in Python.
```

**Describing results** (present):
```latex
% Correct
Table 1 shows the results.
Figure 2 illustrates the architecture.
The results demonstrate that...
```

**General truths** (present):
```latex
% Correct
Machine learning is a branch of AI.
Neural networks consist of layers.
```

### Present Perfect

**Use for**: Actions with present relevance

```latex
% Correct
Recent studies have shown that...
Researchers have proposed various methods...
```

## Subject-Verb Agreement

### Singular vs. Plural

**Error**: Mismatch between subject and verb

```latex
% Bad
The results shows that...
Each method have advantages...

% Good
The results show that...
Each method has advantages...
```

### Collective Nouns

```latex
% Correct
The data show that... (data is plural)
The dataset shows that... (dataset is singular)
```

## Word Choice

### "Make" vs. "Do" vs. "Conduct"

**Academic context**:
```latex
% Bad

% Good

We performed experiments.
```

### "Research" vs. "Study"

```latex
% Correct

```

### "Very" and Intensifiers

**Avoid overuse**:
```latex
% Weak
The results are very good.

% Better
The results are excellent.
The results are significant.
```

## Sentence Structure

### Run-on Sentences

**Error**: Multiple independent clauses without proper punctuation

```latex
% Bad

% Good
The model achieves high accuracy, and it outperforms baselines.
% or
The model achieves high accuracy. It outperforms baselines.
```

### Sentence Fragments

**Error**: Incomplete sentences

```latex
% Bad
Because the model is efficient.

% Good

```

### Parallel Structure

**Error**: Inconsistent structure in lists

```latex
% Bad
